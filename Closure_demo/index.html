<!--Closure is the combiantion of functions bundeled together, closure gives us the access of the outer function scope from an inner function -->

<!-- Function along with its lexical scope returned is the CLOSURE-->

<!-- Here inner function tries to find 'a' in its local scope, doesnot find it goes to its lexical parent scope and then it logs 7 -->

<!--

(3) functions like 'once'
(4) Memoize
(5) setTimeouts
(6) Iterators
(7) Maintain state in async world
