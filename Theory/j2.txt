=> How JavaScript works ?
  --> Everything in Js happens inside an execution context.
      Execution contect is like a big box having 2 components:
         (1) Memory(variable eviornment) ~> all the variables and components are stored in key value pair
         (2) Code(Thread of execution) ~> here all codes are executed one line at a time.
   
  --> Js is synchronous single threaded language
       ~> it means js can only execute one command at a time that too in a order/sequence
  
  --> Js code execution:
     Phase one  : Memory allocation in callstack
     Phase two : Code Execution
