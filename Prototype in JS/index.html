<!--what is prototype?-->
<!-- When we create a js object, js engine automatically without our knowing attaches our object with some hidden properties.
and we get the access to that properties -->
<!-- It's a mechanism by which js objects inherit  -->

<!-- The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add methods and properties in objects. 
It is a method by which an object can inherit the properties and methods of another object -->

<!-- Everything in js is an object be it an array, an object or function, which end up to null.  -->
<!-- This is known as "Prototype chain" -->
