<!-- What are Promises ?

Promises is a way through which we can deal with asynchronous operations in JavaScript. We know that callback functions were initially 
used to handle asynchronous operations. However, callbacks functions were limited in terms of functionality and often led to confusing
code, so, promises were introduced to deal with these problems

A promise in JavaScript is similar to a promises we do in real life. When we make a promise, it is a guarantee that in future, 
we are going to do something.in JavaScript, when we define a promise, either it will be resolved when the time comes,
or it will get rejected. According to MDN, “the Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous 
operation and its resulting value.”

A promise is an object which takes a callback and executes it aysnchronously. A promise is considered easier to use and maintain than callbacks.

A promise has three states:
pending: It is the initial state.
Fulfilled: It indicates that the promised operation was successful.
Rejected: It indicates that the promised operation was unsuccessful. -->


<!-- Promises.all

The Promise.all() method is actually a method of Promise object,that takes an array of promises(an iterable) as an input.
It returns a single Promise that resolves when all of the promises passed as an iterable, which have resolved or when the iterable contains no promises.
In simple way, if any of the passed-in promises reject, the Promise.all() method asynchronously rejects the value of the promise that already rejected, 
whether or not the other promises have resolved.  -->

<!-- Promise.all is actually a promise that takes an array of promises as an input (an iterable). Then it gets resolved when all the promises get resolved or 
any one of them gets rejected -->


<!-- Promise.race -->
 <!-- The Promise. race() method returns a promise that fulfills or rejects as soon as one of the promises in an iterable fulfills or rejects,
 with the value or reason from that promise. -->
