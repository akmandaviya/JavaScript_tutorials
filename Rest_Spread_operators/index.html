<!-- JavaScript uses three dots (...) for both the rest and spread operators. But these two operators are not the same.
The main difference between rest and spread is that the rest operator puts the rest of some specific user-supplied values into a 
javaScript array. But the spread syntax expands iterables into individual elements. -->

<!-- Rest operators:
List of items converted in to an array.
The text after the rest operator references the values you wish to encase inside an array. 
We can only use it before the last parameter in a function definition. -->


<!-- Spread operators:
Array converted to list of items(vice-versa of rest). -->
