<!-- Debouncing
Debouncing in JavaScript is a practice used to improve browser performance. There might be some functionality in a web page which requires 
time-consuming computations. If such a method is invoked frequently, it might greatly affect the performance of the browser, as JavaScript
 is a single threaded language. Debouncing is a programming practice used to ensure that time-consuming tasks do not fire so often, 
 that it stalls the performance of the web page. In other words, it limits the rate at which a function gets invoked. -->
